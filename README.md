neural network for earthquake prediction - deep learning for earthquake prediction.

<p>
<h2>
For many years of research, scientists have not learned how to predict such catastrophes as earthquakes in advance.
Despite the fact that a lot of attention has been paid to the study of the application of deep learning in seismic forecasts, we are still far from good predictions.
Nevertheless, after analyzing 77 articles over 6 months on the application of neural networks to seismology, I came to the conclusion that all of these articles have one common defect - none of the researchers consider earthquake sources in data statistics for a long period in the past.
My assumption (working hypothesis) is that a future earthquake is screaming at us that it will happen soon. For a long time I was engaged in astrophysics, supernovae, for example. In supernovae, a cataclysm occurs - an explosion, and we can find out about it in advance (by the neutrino flux). In the same way, we would be able to know about the impending earthquake in advance if we studied all the available data well.
The successes of modern deep learning show that we can succeed and thereby we can save many human lives in the long run.
The author of these lines is not a specialist in deep learning and has never been adequately engaged in it. All I do now is create websites, web applications and nothing more. But I always wanted to do something more, something that could benefit people.
I hope this project will be realized someday. And so that it reminds me of myself more often, I decided to place it here - in the place that I visit many times a day ...
